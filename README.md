# Sega CD Mode 1 Demo
Old abandoned demo utilizing mode 1. Comes with Sega CD detection, a graphics operation demo, and (unfinished) sequenced PCM music playback.

## How to play
Should boot on hardware if you have a Sega CD attached. In Kega Fusion, make sure that "CartBootEnabled" is set to "1" in Fusion.ini. Should work with Genesis Plus GX (not on BizHawk, unfortunately) out of the box if you have a Sega CD BIOS.
